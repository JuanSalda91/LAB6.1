# TypeScript and Object-Oriented Programming

## Challenge

1. Add a DiscountableProduct interface that includes a method applyDiscount(). Implement this interface in one of the product classes.
2. Implement a module to handle sorting products by price or by name.
3. Add a new feature to the inventory system: bulk discounts for physical products over a certain quantity or size.

## Critical Thinking

After completing the lab, consider the following questions:

1. How does TypeScript enforce type safety in this object-oriented program?

2. How did inheritance reduce code duplication for PhysicalProduct and DigitalProduct?

3. What are the benefits of using encapsulation and access modifiers (public, private, protected) in this context?

4. If you had to add a new type of product (e.g., a SubscriptionProduct), how would polymorphism make this extension straightforward?
